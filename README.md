# Fragmentation Pattern Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA in DIPG cell lines

# Description

The research aimed to analyze how ctDNA fragmentation patterns are affected by drug induced tumor cell death. DIPG cell line PBT29 was treated with four chemotherapeutic drugs: GB13, Quisinostat, Pevonedistat, and Temozolomide (TMZ). ctDNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants and sequenced using low-pass whole genome sequencing. 

# Features
  Low pass whole genome sequencing using illumina
  The slurm file contains the DNA sequencing pipelines, including the sequence alignment using BWA, filtering bam files using samtools, producing fragment size metrices using picard
  The two R files contains the script for fragment pattern analysis using R.
  
# The codes can be found in the master folder of this repository
